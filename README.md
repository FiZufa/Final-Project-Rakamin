## Introduction
Predicting the price of Airbnb listings can help hosts set competitive and optimized rates. This project explores how data science is implemented to analyze and predict Airbnb room prices based on various features.

## Problem Statement
Setting the right price for an Airbnb listing is crucial for maximizing revenue and attracting customers. However, hosts often face challenges due to the wide range of factors influencing prices, such as location, amenities, and reviews. This project aims to develop a predictive model to address this issue.

## Goals and Objectives
- Analyze the factors affecting Airbnb room prices.  
- Build a machine learning model to predict room prices.  
- Provide actionable insights for Airbnb hosts.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Airbnb Prices in European Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities) on Kaggle.

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing values were handled.  
- Numerical columns were normalized.  
- Categorical features were encoded using [e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding].  

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - **Univariate Analysis:**  
     - Examined individual features to understand their distribution and characteristics.  
     - Key actions:  
       - Plotted histograms, bar charts, and boxplots for numerical and categorical features.  
       - Identified skewness, outliers, and missing values.  

   - **Multivariate Analysis:**  
     - Explored relationships between multiple features to identify patterns and correlations.  
     - Key actions:  
       - Created pair plots and correlation heatmaps to evaluate dependencies among numerical features.  
       - Visualized relationships between categorical and numerical variables using boxplots and violin plots.  
       - Analyzed interaction effects, such as the influence of `room_type` and `city` on price.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   -   Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Handle outliers
      - Detect using IQR methods.
      - Standardization
         - Log transformation for Right-skewed features.
         - Square-root transformation for Left-skewed features.
         - Cube-root transformation for moderate left-skewed features.
      - Remove outliers by winsorization with percentile [0.05, 0.95].
      - Feature Encoding
         - Binary label encoding for features with two categories.
         - One-hot encoding for features with more than two categories.
      - Feature scaling
         - Apply Min-Max scaling for numerical features.
      - Data splitting
         - Train:Test = 8:2
